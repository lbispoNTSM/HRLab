# Microsoft Teams Talent Management Sample App in .NET/C#

This app simulates connection to a recruiting and talent management system and allows users and teams to create, manage and search positions and candidates. The content is randomly generated to simulate what you can do with Teams. The full source code is provided, along with the app package and manifest that you can use to side load and test in your Teams environment.

This .NET/C# sample only shows the Bot, Tab, and Messaging Extension portion of the sample.  For more information on the Connector support in this sample, please review the [Node repository](../Node/readme.md)
